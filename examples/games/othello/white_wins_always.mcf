% The formula below expresses that white wins in the Othello game.
% Either white wins right away, or if red, who starts, can move, 
% there is a winning move of White, or
% white can pass or do a move, after which white will win. 
% As the game always terminates, the fixed point has no relevance. 

mu X.(<WhiteWins>true ||
      (<Pass||exists x,y:Pos.RedMove(x,y)>true && [Pass||exists x,y:Pos.RedMove(x,y)]
           (<WhiteWins>true ||
            <Pass||exists x,y:Pos.WhiteMove(x,y)>X)))
