% This formula expresses that red has a winning strategy in the game "four in a row"
% as specified in four_in_a_row.mcrl2. Note that red does not win if yellow cannot do a move
% at the end of the game. This is enforced by the clause exists y:Pos.<YellowMoves(y)>true.

mu X.(<RedMoves>(<RedWins>true || ((<YellowMoves>true) && [YellowMoves](X && [YellowWins]false))))
